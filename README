Forked from FireCore as the project has been abandonned for a while, and i'd quite like to get it working again.

The plan is to remove the itunes 10.5 automation and create an 'IPSW Generator' without a dependent itunes version, because in its current state it will generate the IPSW then break after uploading iBSS + iBEC.

I apologize if I missed anyone in the credits file that deserved credits, If I did miss anyone please let me know.

This is the initial commit, it is going to be lacking on installation instructions and a thorough readme, will look to make this a bit more concise in the future.
